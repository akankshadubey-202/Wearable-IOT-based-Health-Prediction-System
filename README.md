# Wearable-IOT-based-Health-Prediction-System

The Health Prediction System using a wearable device is a project aimed at developing a robust and efficient solution for real-time tracking of our frontline warriors' health and sending an alert message to the base station for immediate medical help. 

## Overview

The system utilizes different sensor data for health tracking, enabling the simultaneous monitoring of soldiers' health. The user interface is designed to be user-friendly, providing an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for users to interact with the system.

## Technologies Used

The project leverages various technologies and frameworks, including:
- Python
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Flask
- SQLite3

These technologies come together to create a comprehensive web-based application. The webpages are responsible for presenting the health data and risk detection alerts to users in a visually appealing manner. The use of SQLite3 for the database enhances the system's capabilities for data storage and retrieval.
